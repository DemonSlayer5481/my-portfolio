    <p>a movie that teaches you to live again. it's about a bully who wants to make amends with his past and self he thinks of dying everyday. <br/>
        and a girl who got bullied who thinks it's better if she was dead because she's a burden (she's mute) watch what happens when these two get together. <br/>

    <p> this movie will teach you how to live. as an introvert you neglect the basic idea of being a human. <br/>
        you'll find out that what truly matters are others, self goes away, ego? bye-bye. you realize there are many beautiful people to be thankful for. <br/>
        and a loving god.

    <p>despite the title the anime is just wholsome, heartwarming and heart breaking. the movie is another chapter of the anime. <br/>
        this movie gave me the greatest gift. it tought me the meaning of true kindness and the hidden connection between <br/> pain, tragedy and kindness, compassion. love.
